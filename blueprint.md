# Stock Recommendation Website Blueprint

## Project Overview
This project aims to create a web-based stock recommendation application. Users will be able to input criteria to receive a list of recommended stock symbols. The application will feature a clean, modern, and responsive user interface, and is monetized using Google AdSense.

## Implemented Features
- Initial setup with `index.html`, `style.css`, and `main.js` files, transformed from a "Food Recommender" to a "Stock Recommender".
- Basic HTML structure for stock search input, recommendation button, and results display.
- Modern and responsive CSS styling for the new stock recommender elements.
- JavaScript logic for displaying mock stock data, filtering based on user input (symbol, name, or sector), and dynamically updating the recommendations.
- **Google AdSense integration:** Added the necessary script to the `<head>` of `index.html` to enable advertisements.

## Plan for Current Request: "구글 에드센스에서 코드를 주고서는 광고를 삽입할려면 head head 사이에 그 코드를 넣으라는데 그냥 그 사이에만 넣기만 하면 되는거야?" (Google AdSense Integration)

### Objective
Integrate Google AdSense into the website to display ads.

### Detailed Steps

1.  **Add AdSense Script to `index.html` (Completed)**
    *   Located the `<head>` section of the `index.html` file.
    *   Inserted the Google AdSense script tag, including a placeholder for the user's client ID.
    *   Confirmed with the user that they need to replace the placeholder with their actual client ID.

2.  **Finalize Project and Update Blueprint (Completed)**
    *   Updated this `blueprint.md` to reflect the completion of the AdSense integration.
    *   Marked all steps as complete.
